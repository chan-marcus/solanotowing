    intro: [
      'Standing water does its worst damage in the first 24 hours. Drywall wicks it up like a sponge, laminate swells, and the pad under your carpet turns into a reservoir that never dries on its own. The single most important thing you can do is get the water out fast, and that is a pump-and-extractor job, not a shop vac job.',
      'Call and a dispatcher connects you with a local crew running truck-mounted extraction. They pull standing water from floors, carpet, and pad, then map the moisture that you cannot see with meters and thermal imaging so nothing wet gets sealed up behind a wall.'

    faq: [
      { q: 'How fast can someone get here?', a: 'Dispatch is 24/7 and crews are local to San Joaquin and Stanislaus Counties. Typical emergency response in Stockton, Modesto, Lodi, Tracy, and Manteca is a matter of hours, not next-day.' },
      { q: 'Should I try to remove the water myself first?', a: 'If it is safe, remove small items and mop what you can, but do not delay the call. Consumer equipment cannot extract water from pad, subfloor, or wall cavities, and that is where mold starts.' },
      { q: 'Is the water dangerous?', a: 'It depends on the source. Clean supply-line water is category 1, but water from drains, appliances, or outside flooding can carry contamination and should be handled with protective equipment.' }

    intro: [
      'This is levee country. Between the Delta, the San Joaquin, the Calaveras, the Mokelumne, and the Tuolumne, homes across the 209 sit closer to water than most of California, and the atmospheric river storms of recent winters proved how fast a low spot, a failed sump, or an overwhelmed storm drain can put inches of water in a living room.',
      'Flood water counts as category 3, which means it can carry silt, sewage, fuel, and bacteria. Cleanup is more than drying: affected porous materials get removed, the structure gets cleaned and disinfected, and everything gets dried and verified with meter readings before rebuild starts.'
    ],
    bullets: [
      { title: 'Category 3 protocols', body: 'Outside flood water is treated as contaminated. Crews wear PPE, remove unsalvageable porous materials, and disinfect the structure.' },

    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'My street floods every big storm. Can you help before it happens?', a: 'The crews we dispatch handle response, not levee work, but if water has entered your home even once, a call is worth it. Prior intrusions often leave hidden moisture and mold that shows up later.' },
      { q: 'Does insurance cover flood damage?', a: 'Standard homeowners policies usually exclude rising water from outside; that is separate flood insurance (NFIP or private). Water from a burst pipe or roof leak is typically covered. Crews document everything either way so you can pursue whatever coverage applies.' },
      { q: 'How long does flood cleanup take?', a: 'Extraction and demo of wet materials usually happens in the first day or two. Structural drying typically runs 3 to 5 days, verified daily with moisture readings.' }

    intro: [
      'A sewage backup is not a mess, it is a biohazard. Black water carries bacteria, viruses, and parasites, and anything porous it touches, carpet, pad, drywall, particleboard cabinets, generally cannot be saved. Older neighborhoods across Stockton, Lodi, and Modesto run on aging clay and Orangeburg laterals, and root intrusion backups are one of the most common emergency calls in the Valley.',

    faq: [
      { q: 'The toilet overflowed but it looks like mostly water. Is that still sewage?', a: 'Any water that has passed a toilet trap or come up a drain is treated as contaminated. Category 2 at best, category 3 if it contains waste. It is not a mop-and-forget situation.' },
      { q: 'Who fixes the actual pipe?', a: 'A plumber clears or repairs the line; restoration crews handle everything the sewage touched. Many callers need both, and dispatch can point you in the right direction.' },
      { q: 'Is sewage damage covered by insurance?', a: 'Many policies exclude sewer backup unless you carry a specific rider. Check for "water backup" coverage on your declarations page. Crews document the loss thoroughly either way.' }

      'Central Valley water is hard, and hard water eats copper. Pinhole leaks in slab-built homes across Tracy, Manteca, and Lathrop can run for weeks before a warm spot on the floor or a spiking water bill gives them away. When a supply line lets go outright, a 1/2-inch pipe can put 50 gallons a minute into your house.',
      'First move: shut off water at the main. Then call. Crews extract, open up what has to be opened, and dry the structure. If the leak is under slab, they work alongside your plumber so leak detection, repair, and drying happen in the right order.'

    faq: [
      { q: 'Where is my water shutoff?', a: 'Usually at the front hose bib area, in the garage, or at the meter box near the sidewalk. Every adult in the house should know where it is. If you cannot find it, dispatch can talk you through it while a crew heads over.' },
      { q: 'The leak was small. Do I really need drying equipment?', a: 'Small leaks that ran for a long time are often worse than big dramatic ones, because water spread slowly through materials. A moisture reading costs you nothing to be sure.' },
      { q: 'Will insurance cover a burst pipe?', a: 'Sudden and accidental discharge is one of the most commonly covered water losses. Long-term leaks can be trickier, which is why crew documentation of the source and timeline matters.' }

    h1: 'Structural Drying & Dehumidification',
    intro: [
      'Extraction gets the water you can see. Drying gets the water you cannot: moisture inside framing, subfloor, drywall, and insulation. Skip it or shortcut it and the Valley\u2019s hot summers turn a wet wall cavity into a mold farm behind fresh paint.',
      'Crews set commercial air movers and low-grain refrigerant dehumidifiers sized to the space, then return daily to take meter readings and adjust equipment. Drying is done when the numbers say it is done, not when the carpet feels dry.'

    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'How long does structural drying take?', a: 'Typically 3 to 5 days for common losses. Dense materials like hardwood and plaster can take longer. Daily readings tell you exactly where things stand.' },
      { q: 'Can I just run fans and open windows?', a: 'Airflow without dehumidification often just moves moisture around, and Valley summer air conditions can slow evaporation. Wall cavities and subfloor need directed airflow plus dehumidification.' },
      { q: 'The equipment is loud. Can it be turned off at night?', a: 'Every hour off extends the dry time and the window for mold growth. Crews will place equipment to minimize disruption, but continuous operation is what gets you done in days instead of weeks.' }

    icon: 'mold',
    h1: 'Mold Remediation in the 209',
    intro: [
      'Mold needs about 48 hours of moisture to get started, which is why it shows up after slow leaks, old flood damage, and drying jobs that never really finished. Musty smell, dark spotting on drywall, or allergy symptoms that clear up when you leave the house are the usual tells.',
      'Proper remediation is not spraying bleach on a wall. Crews build containment with negative air pressure so spores do not spread, remove affected materials under HEPA filtration, treat the structure, and fix the moisture source, because mold always comes back if the water problem stays.'
    ],
    bullets: [
      { title: 'Containment and negative air', body: 'Plastic containment and HEPA-filtered negative air machines keep spores out of the rest of the house.' },
      { title: 'Source correction', body: 'Remediation includes finding and addressing the moisture source, or the mold returns.' },

      { title: 'Verification', body: 'Post-remediation the area is HEPA vacuumed, treated, and can be cleared with third-party testing if desired.' }
    ],
    faq: [
      { q: 'Is bleach enough for mold on drywall?', a: 'No. Bleach does not penetrate porous materials, so it kills surface growth while roots survive inside the material. Moldy drywall generally needs to be removed.' },
      { q: 'Is the mold in my house dangerous?', a: 'Reactions vary by person and species. People with asthma, allergies, or immune issues are most affected. Regardless of species, indoor mold growth means a moisture problem that needs fixing.' },
      { q: 'Does insurance pay for mold remediation?', a: 'Often only when the mold resulted from a covered water loss, and many policies cap mold coverage. Fast response to water damage is the best way to keep mold out of the claim entirely.' }

      'When an atmospheric river parks over the Valley, dispatch boards light up: roof leaks over bedroom ceilings, wind-lifted shingles, fences into windows, and water finding every unsealed penetration. The 2023 storm runs showed how much damage back-to-back systems can do to housing stock that mostly sees dry weather.',

      { q: 'Water is dripping through a light fixture. What do I do?', a: 'Kill the breaker to that circuit before anything else, then place containers and call. Water in electrical fixtures is a shock and fire risk.' },
      { q: 'Should I poke a hole in my bulging ceiling?', a: 'A small relief hole into a bucket can prevent a larger collapse, but only if you are confident about what is above it. Crews would rather you wait the short time it takes them to arrive.' },
      { q: 'Do you repair the roof too?', a: 'Emergency tarping is part of the response. Permanent roof repair is a roofing contractor job, and crews can hand off with photos and documentation of the damage.' }

      'Older homes across central Stockton, Lodi, and Modesto sit on raised foundations, and the crawl space under them is where water problems hide. High water tables near the Delta, broken supply lines, and failed drainage all end up in the same place: standing water under your floor that you might not find for months.',
      'The tell is usually a musty smell, cupping hardwood, or a sagging floor. Crews pump out standing water, remove soaked insulation, dry the framing, and can install vapor barriers so the space stays dry.'

    faq: [
      { q: 'How do I know if there is water under my house?', a: 'Musty odors, cupped or buckling wood floors, cold damp-feeling floors, and increased pest activity are common signs. A crew can inspect and take moisture readings quickly.' },
      { q: 'Is crawl space water really an emergency?', a: 'It is rarely as dramatic as a burst pipe, but standing water under a home rots framing, feeds mold, and attracts pests. The bill grows the longer it sits.' },
      { q: 'Where does the water come from?', a: 'Common sources in the 209: supply or drain line leaks under the house, poor exterior drainage during storms, irrigation, and seasonal high water tables near rivers and the Delta.' }

      { q: 'My water heater is 12 years old. Is that a problem?', a: 'Tank water heaters commonly fail between 8 and 12 years, and Valley hard water shortens that. If yours is in that range, know where your shutoff is and consider proactive replacement.' },
