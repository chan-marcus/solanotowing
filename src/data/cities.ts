      'Stockton is a water town. The Deep Water Channel runs right into downtown, Smith Canal and the Calaveras River thread through the north side, and much of the city sits at or near sea level behind levees. That geography means high water tables, storm drainage that gets overwhelmed in big atmospheric river years, and crawl spaces that collect water under the older homes around the Miracle Mile, Midtown, and Victory Park.',

    intro: [
      'Modesto grew up along the Tuolumne River, and the neighborhoods closest to it, the airport district and the areas around Tuolumne River Regional Park, know what high water years look like. Dry Creek cuts through the east side of town and has its own history of jumping its banks in big storm years, backing water into yards and crawl spaces around La Loma.',

      'Tracy boomed in waves, the 90s tracts around Tracy Hills of the day, the 2000s growth off Corral Hollow, and the current wave around Ellis and Tracy Hills proper. Almost all of it is slab-on-grade construction, and slab homes hide their leaks: hard Valley water works on copper and builder-grade fittings until a warm spot on the floor or a water bill spike gives it away.',
